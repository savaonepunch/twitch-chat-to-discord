# twitch-chat-to-discord
App to show your Twitch chat inside of a d Discord channel in real-time. It works by getting twitch messages with [TMI.js](https://tmijs.com/) and then sending them to Discord with the Discord Webhook library for JS, [discord-webhook-node](https://github.com/matthew1232/discord-webhook-node). The app also automatically gets each user's profile picture from Twitch's "Helix" API via [Axios](https://axios-http.com/).
